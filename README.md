# [Dodge Lab Website](https://dodge-research-group.github.io/dodgelab-website/)

This website is based on the [Hugo Research Group Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-research-group). See below for details on how to make changes.

## Useful links

Hugo Blox [templates](https://hugoblox.com/templates/) come in two types of content blocks, those that use [Tailwind](https://hugoblox.com/blocks/) CSS and those that use [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.hugoblox.com/blocks/). The Hugo Research Group Theme is a Bootstrap template. The Hugo Blox maintainer, George Cushen, [indicated](https://discord.com/channels/722225264733716590/1262792177923391589/1263580594952999084) on the Discord server that some users have adapted the Tailwind-based [Academic CV](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/academic-cv/) template for use with a research group or university.

## Publications

The Hugo Blox documentation has [instructions](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/#publications) on how
to add publications automatically, but our current preferred method is just to duplicate the directory of an existing
publication and modify the contents accordingly. The directory name should be in the format `last_name-YYYY`, where
`last_name` is the last name of the first author, written all in lower case. Each directory requires an `index.md` file that includes the article title, authors, publication type, publication title, DOI, etc. The `publication-type` field
will typically be either `article-journal` for a published article or `article` for an arXiv preprint. A full list of CSL (citation style language) publication types are available
[here](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html#appendix-iii-types).
The directory should also include a `cite.bib` file with citation information in BibTeX format, which is usually available
at the journal website. Hugo Blox will link the article title to a separate summary page that can include additional
images and summary information, as described in the
[documentation](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/#enhancing-publications).

### Article PDFs

Check the journal reuse policy before including the PDF of a journal article on the group website. You can always post
the PDF of a preprint that appears on the arXiv, but many journals prohibit authors from posting the version that has
been formatted by the journal. Some journals even prohibit publishing any version that has been revised in response to
their peer review process.

#### Journals that allow authors to post as-published articles (version of record)

- [Optics Express](https://opg.optica.org/content/author/portal/item/review-copyright-permissions/#posting)
- [Physical Review](https://journals.aps.org/copyrightFAQ.html#post)

#### Journals that do not allow authors to post as-published articles

- [Applied Optics](https://opg.optica.org/content/author/portal/item/review-copyright-permissions/#posting)
- [Applied Physics Letters](https://publishing.aip.org/resources/researchers/rights-and-permissions/permissions/)
