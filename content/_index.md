      text: "The Dodge Laboratory at Simon Fraser University examines the emergent quantum
      properties of materials using femtosecond pulses of light.
      
              * We employ **optical spectroscopy** to understand the physics of solids.
              
              * We focus on **quantum materials** such as superconductors, magnetic 
              materials, and topological electronic materials.
              
              * We are **experimentalists** with specialties in pulsed laser techniques 
              such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and  pump-probe spectroscopy."
