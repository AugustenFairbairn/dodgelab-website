      subtitle: ''
      text: "The Dodge Laboratory at Simon Fraser University examines the emergent quantum properties of materials using femtosecond pulses of light.
* We employ **optical spectroscopy** to understand the physics of solids.
* We focus on **quantum materials** such as superconductors, magnetic materials, and topological electronic materials.
* We are **experimentalists** with specialties in pulsed laser techniques such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and  pump-probe spectroscopy."
