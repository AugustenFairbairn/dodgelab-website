Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) takes two electromagnetic pulses to investigate the electromagnetic responses of various matter over the terahertz frequency range. Typically, one of these electromagnetic pulses will have interacted with the material while the other has not.
A typical measurement compares
two electromagnetic pulses, one of which has interacted with a material and another which
has not. The pulses are measured as a time function, and signal processing techniques are required in order to relate the time function to the frequency function of the electromagnetic pulses. The ThzTools Python package has tools to help with the methods of THz-TDS analysis.
